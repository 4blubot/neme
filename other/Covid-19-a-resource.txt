As our world is falling apart, and most people are spatially distancing themselves, social media and electronic communications are stronger than ever. The problem of course is that social media threads and emails tend to disappear after a few days. As such, here at NeMe,  we decided to compile a resource of information that we think that it will be useful to our community. We will be updating this page as more information becomes available. If we violate any copyrights with this action, we apologise.
