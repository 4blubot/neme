As our world is falling apart, and most people are spatially distancing themselves, social media and electronic communications are stronger than ever. The problem, of course, is that social media threads and emails tend to disappear after a few days. As such, here at NeMe,  we decided to compile a resource of information that we think that it will be useful to our community. We will be updating this page as more factual information becomes available. If we violate any copyrights with this action, we apologise. 

In order to see the changes to this page, please visit <txp::ext url="https://github.com/colak/neme/blame/master/other/Covid-19-a-resource.txt" txt="GitHub" />.

To start here is a tweet by <txp::ext url="https://twitter.com/BrentToderian/status/1241569035642376193" txt="Brent Toderian" />:

bq. Attention World: <p>We don't need #SocialDistancing. We need #SpatialDistancing, & #SocialBridging. Keep physical distance from others, but do all you can to stay socially connected to friends, family & your communities. </p><p>Spread the word. Language matters. #COVIDãƒ¼19 #coronavirus</p>

h2. Advice

This list is still under audit. If you are a doctor do let us know of any corrections we need to do, using the form at the bottom. Many thanks to Dr Dan Pinkel for the corrections so far.

* Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. 
* The virus is an RNA molecule covered by a protective layer of lipid (fat), which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa,  replicates itself within the cells, and it is believed that eventually kills those cells and disperses the new virus particles to infect other cells in a chain reaction.
* The disintegration time of the virus depends on the temperature, humidity, and type of material where it lies. 
* The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap is the best remedy, because the foam cuts the fat (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam). By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own. 
* Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 65% dissolves any fat, especially the external lipid layer of the virus. 
* Antibacterial agents do not kill viruses because they are not bacteria, and so the things antibiotics target, the viruses do not have.
* It has been reported that in laboratory conditions Covid 19 disintegrates after 
** 3 hours (fabric and porous), 
** 4 hours (copper and wood), 
** 24 hours (cardboard), 
** 42 hours (metal) 
** and 72 hours (plastic). 
* It is believed that virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial ventilation systems such as air conditioners in houses, the fridge, the freezer, and cars. It has been reported that, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments can degrade it faster. 
* It is believed that the virus cannot go through healthy skin. 
* Vinegar is not useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat. 
* Alcoholic beverages do not help. The strongest vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 65%. 
* Naturally ventilate your homes as much as possible. 
* You have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc. 
* Excess washing dries hands. Moisturise your hands. 
* Also keep your nails short so that the virus does not hide there.

h3. Protect Yourself (and Others)

* Stay home as much as possible and reduce visitors.
* Practice spatial distancing:
** Stay at least 2 metres away from others in public places.
** Call friends and family or meet using online video services such as Skype, Viber, etc.
* If you are not working in a sector which is vital to your community, such as health, social work, food sales and distribution, etc, persuade your employer that it is possible to work from home.
* Avoid public transport. Walk instead. 
* Avoid people who appear sick. 
* Remember that people who appear well, might be infected by the virus and they can transmit it.
* Go grocery shopping and run errands during off-peak times.
* Practice good hygiene wherever you are.
** Wash your hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, especially:
*** After being in public places and touching any metal or plastic surfaces such as door handles, shopping carts, elevator buttons, etc.
*** After using the bathroom
*** Before preparing food
** If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
** Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially with unwashed hands.
** If you cough or sneeze, do so in the bend of your elbow. If you use a tissue, throw it away immediately.
